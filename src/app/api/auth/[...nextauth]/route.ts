export const dummy = {};

// Example: Exporting a POST handler for NextAuth
export const POST = async (request: Request, context: any) => {
  // Your authentication logic here
  return new Response('Authenticated', { status: 200 });
};

// You can also export other handlers (GET, PUT, etc.) as needed
